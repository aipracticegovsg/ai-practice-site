# Data Science Manager Role

## Why Data Science Management is Different

Managing Data Science and AI teams presents unique challenges compared to traditional software engineering. The **Data Science Manager (DSM)** must bridge the deterministic world of software engineering with the probabilistic world of data science and machine learning.

### The Core Conflict

-   **Software Engineering:** Deterministic. Input A + Code B = Output C.
-   **AI/Research:** Probabilistic. Input A + Code B = Output C (maybe, with 85% accuracy).

The DSM's primary role is managing this **uncertainty risk** while ensuring the team delivers tangible value.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Managing Research Velocity vs. Production Stability

-   **Research Mode:** Creating space for the "Research Scientist" to fail fast and experiment without bureaucratic overhead.
-   **Production Mode:** Enforcing strict rigor (testing, linting, latency budgets) for the "AI Engineer/ Data Scientist" when deploying models.
-   **The Balance:** Knowing when to switch a project from research to production.

### 2. Talent Archetype Management

Unlike a standard SWE team, an AI team is heterogeneous. The DSM must:

-   Coach **Research Scientists** on code quality and reproducibility.
-   Coach **AI Engineers** on statistical validity and model behavior.
-   Ensure **Applied Scientists** are effectively translating between the two.

### 3. Technical Strategy & Ethics

-   **Buy vs. Build:** Deciding when to use an off-the-shelf API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) vs. fine-tuning an open-source model.
-   **AI Safety:** enforcing guardrails, bias testing, and responsible AI practices.

## Competencies for DSMs

| Competency | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Probabilistic Thinking** | Ability to plan roadmaps around deliverables that have success rates, not just completion dates. |
| **Data Strategy** | Understanding data acquisition, labeling costs, and privacy implications (GDPR/PDPA). |
| **Full-Stack Awareness** | Sufficient knowledge of the modern AI stack (Vector DBs, Orchestration, GPUs) to make architectural decisions. |

## Transitioning to DSM

We encourage Senior/Staff Data Scientists and AI Engineers (Grade I+) to transition into this role. The transition requires a shift from "optimizing model accuracy" to "optimizing team throughput and business impact."
