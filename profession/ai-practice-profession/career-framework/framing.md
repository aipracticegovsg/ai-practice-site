# Framing & Rationale

## Framing: Modernized Hiring for 2026

The landscape of AI hiring is broken. Traditional LeetCode-style interviews fail to capture a Data Scientist's intuition, while academic whiteboard sessions fail to assess an AI Engineer's coding standards.

Our "Modernized Hiring" strategy focuses on standardizing intake to identify the right **archetypes** and **skill fits** from day one.

## Rationale: What We Test

We are moving away from "trivia" (e.g., "Explain the formula for backpropagation") toward **Behavioral and Practical** signals.

### The 4 Signals
We look for these four specific traits during the process:

1.  **⚡ Agility:** Quick thinking and on-the-spot reasoning. Can the candidate pivot when the data changes?
2.  **⏳ Pace:** The ability to solve problems within realistic timeframes (simulated via time-boxed case studies).
3.  **🧱 Baseline:** Non-negotiable scripting (Python/SQL) and core ML model building skills.
4.  **🌟 Depth:** Mastery over specific specialized topics (The "M" shape).

### The Shift in Assessment
-   **Old Way:** Take-home datasets that take 1 week (High drop-off, easy to cheat).
-   **New Way:** Live Case Studies and Problem Decomposition sessions.

We value the **process of thinking** over the syntax of the solution.
