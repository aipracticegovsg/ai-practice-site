Welcome to GovTech’s Data Science & AI Engineering Career Framework.

This documentation defines how we grow, support, and evaluate Data Scientists, AI Engineers, and AI Leaders — with clarity, fairness, and alignment to our evolving mission in the age of Artificial Intelligence.

---

## 🔭 Overview

These frameworks are structured around **archetypes, competencies, and impact**.
They provide a shared language for:

- **Specialization with Baseline:** Encouraging deep expertise in specific domains while maintaining essential foundational skills.
- **Career Pathways:** Clear routes for Research Scientists, Applied Scientists, and AI Engineers.
- **Performance & Promotion:** Calibrating impact based on behavior and outcomes, not just technical knowledge.

Each framework includes:

- **Archetype Definitions:** The three distinct tracks (Research, Applied, AI Engineering).
- **Competency Maps:** The "M-shaped" skill requirements (Baseline vs. Depth).
- **Impact Guide:** How technical outputs translate to business value.

## 📘 Framing

- [Framing](/career-framework/framing/)
  → Why we updated the track for 2026: The shift from generalist data science to specialized AI engineering.
- [Redefining DS & AI Roles](/career-framework/redefine-data-ai-roles/)
  → The three archetypes: Research Scientist, Applied Scientist, and AI Engineer.
- [AI Engineering Manager Role](/career-framework/ai-engineering-manager-role/)
  → Role definition: Managing uncertainty, bridging research to production, and leading high-velocity AI teams.

## 🧬 The "M-Shaped" Scientist/Engineer

We value deep expertise. Our framework is built on the philosophy that while you must possess a broad baseline of skills, your career progression is driven by your depth in specific areas.

- **Baseline:** Every role maintains foundational skills in AI Performance, Operations, and Communication.
- **Depth (The Peak):** Achieving Level 3 (L3) mastery in one specialization qualifies you as L3 for the category.

---

## 🧰 Supporting Materials

- **Self-Assessment Quizzes:** Test your baseline knowledge in NLP, MLOps, and Statistics.
- **Learning Paths:** Curated resources to help you bridge gaps in your "M-shape".

## 📬 Feedback & Iteration

The field of AI changes weekly. This framework is designed to be adaptive. We welcome input to keep our competencies relevant to industry developments (e.g., Agentic Systems, Multimodal LLMs).
