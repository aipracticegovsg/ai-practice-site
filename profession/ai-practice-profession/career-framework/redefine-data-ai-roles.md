# Redefining DS & AI Roles

**Status**: Aligned for 2026 Profession Track Update

## The Three Archetypes

To better align with industry standards and internal project needs, we have defined three core archetypes. An individual may drift between these over their career, but at any given time, their role should align with one primary focus.

### 1. Research Scientist
**"The Explorer"**
-   **Focus:** Improving performance through experimentation with technologies from academia and industry.
-   **Mission:** Pushes the boundaries of what is technically possible.
-   **Key Output:** Novel model architectures, white papers, proof-of-concepts (POCs) that solve previously unsolvable problems.
-   **Primary Competency:** AI Performance & Evaluation.

### 2. Applied Scientist
**"The Bridge"**
-   **Focus:** Identifying relevant technologies and applying them effectively to real-world problems.
-   **Mission:** Balances model performance with business constraints and communication.
-   **Key Output:** Production-grade models, technical strategy, translation of business needs into mathematical problems.
-   **Primary Competency:** Data Analysis & Communication / AI Performance.

### 3. AI Engineer
**"The Builder"**
-   **Focus:** Masters of infrastructure, operations, and system design.
-   **Mission:** Ensures technologies are deployed in a fast, scalable, and secure manner.
-   **Key Output:** Inference pipelines, RAG systems, MLOps platforms, optimized latency/throughput.
-   **Primary Competency:** AI Operation & Deployment.

## The Competency Map

We map these archetypes against three broad domains. Crucially, the list of sub-competencies is **adaptive** to allow for rapid industry updates.

### Domain 1: AI Performance & Evaluation
*Rigorous assessment of AI model performance and continuous evaluation.*
-   **Sub-competencies:**
    -   **Statistical Techniques:** Probability, experimental design, causal inference, Bayesian stats.
    -   **Model Evaluation:** Advanced metrics, benchmarking, human-in-the-loop eval.
    -   **Machine Learning:** Traditional ML (Trees, Boosting) and Deep Learning.
    -   **NLP & LLMs:** Transformers, Attention mechanisms, Multimodal architectures.

### Domain 2: AI Operation & Deployment
*Practical expertise in managing AI life-cycles and secure deployment.*
-   **Sub-competencies:**
    -   **MLOps:** CI/CD for ML, model registry, feature stores.
    -   **Optimization:** Quantization, distillation, algorithmic efficiency, latency reduction.
    -   **System Design:** Agentic patterns (ReACT), vector database management, scalable inference.

### Domain 3: Data Analysis & Communication
*Transforming complex results into actionable narratives.*
-   **Sub-competencies:**
    -   **Visualization:** Communicating uncertainty and probability to non-technical stakeholders.
    -   **Product Sense:** Translating vague problem statements into strict data requirements.

## Baseline vs. Specialization

Every role requires a **Baseline** in all three domains, but **Specialization** in their archetype's primary domain.

**Example Baseline Requirements (Must Have):**
-   **NLP:** Understand basic principles of Transformers (Attention).
-   **MLOps:** Understand basic components of an ML system design.
-   **Statistics:** Pass basic hypothesis testing and probability checks.

*Note: We provide self-testing quizzes for these baselines. If you don't know it, learn it now.*
