## 1. Automated Baseline Test
*   **Tools:** HackerRank / CodeSignal / Internal Platform.
*   **Content:**
    *   **All Roles:** Python scripting (pandas/numpy manipulation), SQL basics.
    *   **DS Track:** Probability questions, Hypothesis testing, Basic ML theory (bias/variance).
    *   **AI Eng Track:** Algorithmic complexity, Basic API construction, System basics.
*   **Passing Criteria:** Must demonstrate fluency. We do not test for "trick" questions.

## 2. Live Case Study (The Core)
This is the most critical part of the process.

**Format:**
The candidate is presented with a vague problem statement (e.g., *"We need to detect fraud in this transaction stream"* or *"Build a RAG system for our internal policy documents"*).

**Evaluation Rubric:**
*   **Problem Decomposition:** Did they break the massive problem into solvable chunks?
*   **Metric Selection:** Did they choose the right success metric (e.g., Precision vs. Recall, Latency vs. Cost)?
*   **Data Strategy:** Did they ask about data availability, labels, and bias?
*   **Modeling:** Did they select an appropriate baseline model before jumping to complex LLMs?
*   **Production Awareness:** (Crucial for AI Engineers) Did they mention latency, cost, and monitoring?

## 3. Two-Way Peer Discussion
*   **Format:** 45-60 mins.
*   **Prompt:** "Present a project you are proud of, or a technical topic you have deep expertise in."
*   **Goal:** To test **Depth**.
*   **Interaction:** The panel will interrupt with "Why?" questions.
    *   *"Why did you choose that loss function?"*
    *   *"What happened when the data distribution shifted?"*
*   **Success Indicator:** The candidate can explain complex concepts simply and defend their technical choices without being defensive.

## 4. AI System Design (For Senior+)
*   **Scenario:** High-scale, production AI system.
*   **Topics:**
    *   Vector Database scaling.
    *   LLM Context window management.
    *   Inference optimization (batching, quantization).
    *   Feedback loops and retraining pipelines.
