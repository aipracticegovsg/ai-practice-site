# Implementation

## Interview Panel Composition

To ensure we hire "M-shaped" individuals, the panel must represent both breadth and depth.

### Minimum Panel Requirements

1.  **Hiring Manager:** Owns the "Fit" and overall decision.
2.  **1 x Domain Expert (Depth):**
    -   If hiring for Applied Scientist, this interviewer must also be an Applied Scientist.
    -   Conducts the **Peer Discussion**.
3.  **1 x Cross-Functional Practitioner (Breadth):**
    -   If hiring a Researcher, this should be an AI Engineer (and vice versa).
    -   Ensures the candidate can collaborate across the Research/Engineering divide.

Note: Domain experts and cross-functional practicioner will be sourced from *the whole of GovTech* and not just from AI Practice. If possible, at least one of them should be from the hiring team.  


## Conducting the Live Case Study

-   **Preparation:** Interviewers must review the case study materials beforehand.
-   **During Session:**
    -   Act as a "co-pilot," not a proctor.
    -   If the candidate gets stuck, offer a hint to unblock them. We want to see how far they can get, not where they get stuck.
-   **Scoring:** Use the standardized scorecard. Avoid "gut feeling."

## Decision Meeting (Bar Raiser)

After all rounds, the panel convenes.

-   **Review:** Discuss the "4 Signals" (Agility, Pace, Baseline, Depth).
-   **Consensus:** Was the "Baseline" met? Was the "Depth" sufficient for the specific role?
-   **Leveling:** Does the candidate fit the applied grade, or should they be leveled up/down?
