## Interview Panel Composition

To ensure we hire "M-shaped" individuals, the panel must represent both breadth and depth.

### Minimum Panel Requirements

1.  **Hiring Manager:** Owns the "Fit" and overall decision.
2.  **1 x Domain Expert (Depth):**
    *   If hiring for NLP, this interviewer must be L3 in NLP.
    *   Conducts the **Peer Discussion**.
3.  **1 x Cross-Functional Practitioner (Breadth):**
    *   If hiring a Researcher, this should be an AI Engineer (and vice versa).
    *   Ensures the candidate can collaborate across the Research/Engineering divide.

## Conducting the Live Case Study

*   **Preparation:** Interviewers must review the case study materials beforehand.
*   **During Session:**
    *   Act as a "co-pilot," not a proctor.
    *   If the candidate gets stuck, offer a hint to unblock them. We want to see how far they can get, not where they get stuck.
*   **Scoring:** Use the standardized scorecard. Avoid "gut feeling."

## Decision Meeting (Bar Raiser)
After all rounds, the panel convenes.
*   **Review:** Discuss the "4 Signals" (Agility, Pace, Baseline, Depth).
*   **Consensus:** Was the "Baseline" met? Was the "Depth" sufficient for the specific role?
*   **Leveling:** Does the candidate fit the applied grade, or should they be leveled up/down?
