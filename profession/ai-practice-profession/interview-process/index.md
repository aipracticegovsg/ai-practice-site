![AI Interview Overview](./ai-interview-intro.png)

Welcome to GovTech's Data Science & AI Engineering Interview Process.

This documentation establishes a standardized, rigorous, and practical interview process for Data Scientists and AI Engineers (Grades D-K). It is designed to identify "M-shaped" talent—practitioners with strong baselines and deep specialization.

**Key Features:**
*   **Archetype-Specific Tracks:** tailored assessments for Research, Applied, and AI Engineering roles.
*   **Practical Over Theoretical:** Focus on "live" problem solving and case studies rather than rote memorization of algorithms.
*   **Two-Way Evaluation:** Peer discussions that allow candidates to teach us, ensuring deep technical alignment.
