# Process Overview

## The Interview Process

The process differs slightly based on the **Archetype** (Research/Applied vs. AI Engineer) and the **Grade**.

---

## 1. Data Scientist (Research & Applied) / AI Engineer (Grades D-H)

1.  **CV & Archetype Screen**
    *   **Goal:** Match candidate to the correct track (Research, Applied, or Engineering).
2.  **Automated Proficiency Test (Baseline)**
    *   **Content:** Statistics, Basic ML concepts, Scripting (Python/SQL).
    *   **Rationale:** A gate for volume; ensures the "Essential Baseline" exists.
3.  **Live Case Study (Problem Decomposition)**
    *   **Format:** 1.5 - 2 hour live session (or condensed 1.5-day take-home followed by review, depending on role seniority).
    *   **Focus:** End-to-end problem solving. From "vague business problem" to "model strategy."
4.  **Technical Deep Dive / Peer Discussion**
    *   **Format:** Candidate presents a topic of their choice or reviews a past project.
    *   **Goal:** Assess **Depth** and communication.
5.  **Candidate Fit Discussion**
    *   **Focus:** Cultural alignment, team fit, growth mindset.

## 2. Senior / Staff / Principal (Grades I-K)

1.  **CV & Portfolio Review**
    *   **Special:** Review of publications (Research) or GitHub/System Architecture (AI Eng).
2.  **Live Case Study (System Design)**
    *   **AI Engineer Focus:** Designing a scalable RAG pipeline, Inference architecture, or MLOps system.
    *   **Scientist Focus:** Designing an experimental framework for a complex, ambiguous problem.
3.  **Two-Way Peer Discussion**
    *   **Format:** "Teach us something new."
    *   **Rationale:** At this level, candidates should be experts. We look for critical thinking and the ability to elevate the team's knowledge.
4.  **Leadership & Fit (Managerial Focus)**
    *   For Staff+, assessment of mentorship and technical strategy capabilities.
