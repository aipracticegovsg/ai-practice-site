## Overview

Data Science and AI talent pools are diverse. Candidates come from purely academic backgrounds, software engineering transitions, or self-taught pathways.

## Academic Candidates (PhD/Post-Doc)

For candidates coming directly from academia (targeting Research Scientist roles):
*   **Portfolio:** Published papers (NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR) can replace portions of the technical screen if they demonstrate clear code implementation.
*   **Adjustment:** Be lenient on "Production Engineering" questions (CI/CD, Kubernetes) but strict on "Scientific Rigor" and "Math."
*   **Leveling:** A fresh PhD graduate typically maps to a mid-level (Grade E/F) individual contributor role, not a Senior role, unless they have significant industry experience.

## Internal Transfers (SWE to AI Engineer)

For Software Engineers within GovTech wishing to transfer to the AI Practice:
*   **Gap Analysis:** Focus the interview heavily on the **AI/ML Baseline** (Statistics, Model Evaluation). We already know they can code.
*   **Apprenticeship:** We offer a specialized "Conversion & Apprenticeship" track (referenced in Slide 2) for internal talent. If they show high potential but lack specific ML depth, consider hiring with a conditional training plan.

## Niche Specializations

If hiring for a highly specific niche (e.g., Reinforcement Learning for Robotics):
*   **External Expert:** If no internal L3 expert exists to conduct the Peer Discussion, invite a trusted external expert or an expert from another government agency to sit on the panel.

### Summary of Outputs

I have generated the following documentation structure, mirroring the SWE reference materials but tailored for DS/AI:

1.  **Career Framework:**
    *   Defined **3 Archetypes** (Research, Applied, AI Eng) to replace the generic "Data Scientist".
    *   Implemented the **"M-Shaped" Competency Model** (Baseline in all, Depth in one).
    *   Created a specific **AI Engineering Manager** role description that addresses the unique challenge of managing probabilistic software.

2.  **Interview Process:**
    *   Designed a **4-Stage Process** focusing on Agility, Pace, Baseline, and Depth.
    *   Replaced standard "System Design" with **"Live Case Studies"** and **"Peer Discussions"**.
    *   Added specific guidance for **GenAI/LLM assessments** (allowing ChatGPT use, testing for RAG/Agents).
    *   Included **Special Considerations** for academic PhDs vs. engineering transfers.

**Key Adaptations from SWE to DS/AI:**
*   **Uncertainty Management:** Explicitly added competencies regarding managing probabilistic outcomes (vs deterministic software).
*   **Archetypes:** Split the single "Software Engineer" track into three distinct flavors to reflect the reality of the AI market in 2026.
*   **Assessment Style:** Shifted from "LeetCode" to "Case Study/Problem Decomposition" as the primary signal generator, acknowledging that AI problems are often open-ended.
*   **Tool Usage:** Explicitly authorized the use of AI tools during interviews to reflect modern workflow.
