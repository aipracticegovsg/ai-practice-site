# Special Considerations

## Overview

Data Science and AI talent pools are diverse. Candidates come from purely academic backgrounds, software engineering transitions, or self-taught pathways.

## Academic Candidates (PhD/Post-Doc)

For candidates coming directly from academia (targeting Research Scientist roles):

-   **Portfolio:** Published papers (NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR) can replace portions of the technical screen if they demonstrate clear code implementation.
-   **Adjustment:** Be lenient on "Production Engineering" questions (CI/CD, Kubernetes) but strict on "Scientific Rigor" and "Math."
-   **Leveling:** A fresh PhD graduate typically maps to a mid-level (Grade F/G) individual contributor role, not a Senior role, unless they have significant industry experience.

## Internal Transfers

For officers within GovTech wishing to change their roles to Data Scientists or AI Engineers:

-   **Gap Analysis:** Focus the interview heavily on the **AI/ML Baseline** (Statistics, Model Evaluation).
-   **Apprenticeship:** We offer a specialized "Conversion & Apprenticeship" track (referenced in Slide 2) for internal talent. If they show high potential but lack specific ML depth, consider hiring with a conditional training plan.

## Niche Specializations

If hiring for a highly specific niche (e.g., Reinforcement Learning for Robotics):

-   **External Expert:** If no internal expert exists to conduct the Peer Discussion, invite a trusted external expert or an expert from another government agency to sit on the panel.
