# Training & FAQ

## Interviewer Training

### Shadowing
New interviewers must shadow at least 2 Live Case Studies and 2 Peer Discussions before conducting one in reverse-shadow (being observed).

### Calibration
We hold quarterly calibration sessions where interviewers review anonymized packets to ensure that a "Strong Hire" in Team A is equivalent to a "Strong Hire" in Team B.

## FAQ

### Q: The candidate is a great Researcher but has weak engineering skills.
**A:** Check the role.
-If hiring for **Research Scientist**: Do they meet the *Baseline* for engineering (can they write clean-ish code)? If yes, hire.
-If hiring for **AI Engineer**: No hire. The engineering bar is non-negotiable for this track.

### Q: Can we skip the Automated Test for Senior candidates?
**A:** For Grade I (Senior) and below, No. For Grade J (Staff/Lead) and above, Yes—we rely on the System Design and Portfolio review to assess technical competence.

### Q: The candidate wants to use ChatGPT during the Live Case Study.
**A:** **Yes, allow it.**
In the real world, they will use AI tools. We want to see *how* they use it. Do they blindly copy-paste code, or do they use it to accelerate boilerplate generation while focusing on the logic?
-*Constraint:* They must be able to explain every line of code generated.

### Q: What if the candidate doesn't know the specific stack (e.g., PyTorch vs TensorFlow)?
**A:** We hire for **Aptitude over Syntax**. If they know TensorFlow deeply, they can learn PyTorch. Focus on their understanding of the underlying concepts (tensors, gradients, graphs).
